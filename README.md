# AutoHotkey Scripts Repository

This repository contains a collection of AutoHotkey (AHK) scripts for automating various tasks and creating keyboard/mouse macros on Windows.

## Root Directory File Summary

*   `Keyboard_bindings.ahk`: Defines the main hotkeys and keyboard shortcuts. It includes environment mode switching (`std`, `work`, `game`, etc.), script control hotkeys, program launching bindings (using the `browser` function), window manipulation hotkeys, media controls, and context-specific hotkeys for applications like SciTE and PDFXEdit. It relies heavily on `init.ahk` for initialization and functions defined in `functions.ahk` and `utils.ahk`.
*   `functions.ahk`: Contains a large collection of AutoHotkey functions used by other scripts, particularly `Keyboard_bindings.ahk`. It includes functions for:
    *   Initialization (`generateMenus`).
    *   Sensors/Input (`listen`, `fullscreen`, `det_screen`, `get_clip_img`, `capture_img`, `find_prog`, `GetText`, `SetGroup`).
    *   Motors/Actions (`run_cmd`, `place_window`, `browser`, `SearchWeb`, `RunScript`, `clip_to_mouse`, `close_win`, `open_regedit`, `tooltip_img`, `refresh_prog`, `GetProgLocation`, `get_pic`, `change_env_mode`).
    *   Program-specific functions (LyX, Rainmeter, Chrome, Spotify, WhatsApp, SciTE).
    *   Class definitions (`PathClass`, `FileClass`, `BB`, `ControlPoint`, `ScheduleClass`) for managing paths, files, context, and scheduling.
*   `utils.ahk`: Provides utility functions used across various scripts. Includes functions for basic computer actions (`GetSelectedText`, `min_all_wins`), list handling (`inlist`, `join`, `range`, `Any`, `All`), string handling (`quote`, `EncodeDecodeURI`, `TimeStamp`, `format_cmd`, `make_file_name`, `replace_Substrings`), file handling (`append_to_file`, `seach_file`, `find_windowsapp_path`), basic arithmetic (`in_rect`, `between`), display management (`get_screens_data`), probing (`AnyWinActive`, `WinID`), sorting (`IndexOf`, `CleanStr`, `bubble_sort`), UI interaction (`print`, `PopTrayTip`, `print_text`, `get_newest_file`, `DetectLang`, `Input`, `MClick`), group management (`make_group`, `group_activate`), INI parsing (`parse_ini`), and file type checking (`check_file_type`). Also contains a `ShellRun` function.
*   `constants.ahk`: Defines global constants and variables used throughout the AHK scripts. This includes debug flags, environment modes, application paths (via `SearchEngines` map), keyboard layout mappings (`KeyMapDict`), control groups for different application types (`control_groups`), screen data structure initialization, and other global settings.
*   `init.ahk`: Initialization script run by other AHK scripts (like `Keyboard_bindings.ahk`). It sets up the environment (`SendMode`, `SetWorkingDir`, etc.), includes core libraries (`constants.ahk`, `functions.ahk`), initializes global objects (`PathClass`, `ScheduleClass`), loads paths from `memory/paths.ini`, loads and renders hotstrings from `memory/hotstrings.ini`, sets up application groups, and handles admin privileges if required. It also conditionally includes `vnc.ahk` based on the environment mode.
*   `console.ahk`: Seems to be a testing or development script containing various snippets, examples, and debugging code related to functions and features found in the main scripts. It includes tests for functions like `range`, INI parsing, window activation, screen coordinates, message boxes, string manipulation, file operations, image handling, clipboard operations, and more. It doesn't appear to be part of the core macro functionality but rather a scratchpad.
*   `sync.bat`: A batch script for synchronizing the repository with Git. It adds all changes, commits them with a message indicating the computer name, and pushes the changes to the remote repository. It includes a check to change directory only if run on a specific computer ("CHRONOS7").
*   `chatgpt.ahk`: Defines context-specific hotkeys and hotstrings for the ChatGPT application (`ahk_exe ChatGPT.exe`). It remaps Enter and Ctrl+Enter, provides a hotkey (`^D`) likely for deleting or dismissing something, and includes several hotstrings for quickly inserting common prompts or instructions like asking for yes/no answers, checking online data, rechecking answers, adding information to memory, and expanding on suggestions.
*   `analytic.ahk`: Contains utility functions for analyzing the system and window environment. Functions include `enum_screens` (list screen details), `name_computer` (show computer name), `get_activeWin_hwnd` (get active window handle), `get_mouse_pos` (get screen mouse coordinates), and `get_pressed_key` (show the last pressed key or key history). Likely used for debugging or information gathering within other scripts.
*   `save_vnc_hotstring.py`: A Python script designed to process a VNC-related text string. It replaces newline characters (`\\n`) with AutoHotkey's newline representation (`\`n`) and removes content within parentheses, except for specific cases like `(clk)`, `(reset)`, or `#()`. The processed text is then saved into a specified JSON file under a given key. It takes the input string, JSON file path, and JSON key as command-line arguments.
*   `hotstrings.ini`: An INI file storing simple key-value pairs for hotstrings, primarily personal contact information (emails, IDs, phone numbers) and a zip code under the `[general_hotstrings]` section. Used by `init.ahk` to load general hotstrings.
*   `classes.ahk`: Defines several AutoHotkey classes: `PathClass` (for managing file paths from an INI file), `FileClass` (for object-oriented file operations like move, rename, copy, delete, read, run), and `BB` (Blackboard?, likely for managing context like active window, clipboard, mouse position), `ControlPoint`. This seems to be an older or alternative version of class definitions also found in `functions.ahk`.
*   `JSON.ahk`: An AutoHotkey library (v2.1.3 by cocobelgica) for parsing JSON strings into AHK objects (`JSON.Load`) and converting AHK values (objects, strings, numbers) into JSON strings (`JSON.Dump`). It supports reviver/replacer functions similar to JavaScript's `JSON.parse`/`JSON.stringify` and includes handling for special characters and Unicode. It also defines a `JSON.Undefined` proxy for representing undefined values.
*   `ahk.py`: A simple Python script that changes the current directory to the AHK scripts directory (defined in a `mine` module) and then runs `python.ahk` using the AutoHotkey executable, passing "xxx" as an argument and capturing the output. Likely used for testing or integrating Python with AHK.
*   `std.ahk`: Provides functions `Stdout` and `Stdin` for interacting with a console window (either a new console or the SciTE output console if the script is run from SciTE). Includes helper functions for file I/O, process checking (`ProcessExist`), and getting process information (`GetScriptParentProcess`, `GetParentProcess`, `GetProcessName`, `GetCurrentProcess`).
*   `dashboard.ahk`: An empty AutoHotkey script file.
*   `watchdog.ahk`: An AutoHotkey script that uses `WatchFolder.ahk` to monitor specified folders (initially the downloads folder defined in `paths`) for changes (added, removed, modified, renamed). When a file is added to the downloads folder, it triggers the `watchdog` function, which creates a `FileClass` object for the new file and calls its `sort` method (likely defined in `functions.ahk` or `classes.ahk`) using paths loaded from the global `paths` object.
*   `touch.ahk`: An experimental script seemingly designed to track mouse movements or touch gestures. It captures mouse coordinates and timestamps on mouse button presses (`LButton`, `RButton`) and continuously updates a tooltip with the current coordinates and time elapsed since the last event while the button is held down.
*   `programs.ahk`: Appears to be a placeholder or incomplete script. It includes several core libraries (`utils.ahk`, `paths.ahk`, `constants.ahk`, `gui_menus.ahk`) but contains no functional code.
*   `ideas.ahk`: Contains various AutoHotkey code snippets and ideas. Includes code for getting the active explorer path, getting image data from the clipboard (`get_clip_img`, `get_clip_img2`), and potentially other experimental or unused fragments.
*   `BinReadWrite.ahk`: Provides functions `GetInteger` and `SetInteger` for reading and writing numerical values (integers of specified size, signed or unsigned) from/to binary data buffers at specific offsets.
*   `Gdip_All.ahk`: A comprehensive GDI+ library for AutoHotkey (v1.45 by tic, modified by Rseding91). It provides a vast array of functions for advanced graphics manipulation, including creating and manipulating bitmaps, drawing shapes (rectangles, ellipses, polygons, lines, Beziers, arcs, pies), filling shapes, drawing text, applying transformations (rotation, scaling, skewing), working with image attributes and color matrices, handling device contexts (DCs), screen capture, saving/loading images in various formats (BMP, JPG, GIF, PNG, TIFF), handling regions and paths, and managing GDI+ resources (pens, brushes, fonts, images, graphics contexts). It also includes helper functions like `UpdateLayeredWindow`, `BitBlt`, `StretchBlt`, `SetImage`, etc.
*   `context_menu.ahk`: Defines functions and data structures for creating and handling custom context menus in AutoHotkey. It uses a `menu_list` associative array to define menu structures (like `:search`, `:runwith`, `:analytics`, `:lyx`) and their items. The `create_menu` function builds AHK menus based on these definitions, and the `context_menu` function handles the display and action logic when a menu item is selected, often using text selected from the active window (`focus.text`). It includes specific logic for applications like LyX.
*   `gui_menus.ahk`: Contains functions specifically for creating GUI elements related to menus, particularly for LyX integration. The `lyx_gui` function handles the creation and interaction logic for a GUI window that allows storing or deleting LyX formulas or menus, interacting with the `add_lyx_item.py` script via `run_cmd`.
*   `WatchFolder.ahk`: A library function (`WatchFolder`) by \'just me\' for monitoring specified folders (and optionally subfolders) for various types of changes (file/directory name changes, attribute changes, size changes, write time changes, etc.). When changes occur, it calls a user-defined function, passing the affected folder path and an array detailing the changes (action type, file/folder name, old name if renamed, directory status). It uses `ReadDirectoryChangesW` and related Windows API calls.
*   `lightmod.ahk`: A simplified or alternative version of the main keybinding script (`Keyboard_bindings.ahk`). It includes basic setup (`SendMode`, `CoordMode`, etc.), includes `context_menu.ahk` and `utils.ahk`, loads hotstrings from `hotstrings.ahk`, defines program launching hotkeys (using the `browser` function), system setting hotkeys, window placement hotkeys, a Spotify hotkey, and a `hub` function hotkey (`#\``). It also includes context-specific hotkeys for Hebrew language input. It seems less feature-rich than `Keyboard_bindings.ahk`.
*   `hotstrings.ahk`: Defines several simple hotstrings, primarily for expanding abbreviations into email addresses, ID numbers, phone numbers, and a Mathematica activation code.
*   `SavePictureAs.ahk`: A large, feature-rich AutoHotkey script designed to save pictures from various web browsers (Edge, IE, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, and many others). It allows users to save pictures by hovering the mouse and pressing a hotkey (default Ctrl+Space). Key features include configurable save locations (default folder, favorites toolbar), customizable filenaming conventions (date/time, sequential/random numbers, original filename, prefix/suffix), duplicate handling rules (ask, don't save, overwrite, rename), history tracking with preview, configurable confirmation messages, screen capture capabilities (area, active window, entire screen), user-defined hotkeys, support for environment variables in paths, custom tray icons, and options for starting with Windows and creating desktop shortcuts. It handles different browser quirks and UAC considerations. Uses GDI+ for image dimension retrieval and MD5 hashing for duplicate detection. It includes an installer/portable setup option.
*   `Installer.ahk`: An AutoHotkey script that serves as an installer/setup program for AutoHotkey itself. It provides options for custom installation (choosing version - Unicode 32/64-bit, ANSI 32-bit), installation path, Start Menu folder creation, installing the script compiler (Ahk2Exe), enabling drag & drop support, setting AutoHotkey as a host app for taskbar pinning, enabling UI Access (for automation requiring elevated privileges), and setting the default script encoding to UTF-8. It also handles upgrading existing installations, uninstalling, and extracting files. It uses a WebBrowser control for its UI but includes fallback options. It manages registry keys for file associations, uninstallation information, and application paths.
*   `WindowSpy.ahk`: A utility script that displays detailed information about the window and control currently under the mouse cursor or the currently active window. It shows the window title, class, process name/PID, mouse coordinates (Screen, Window, Client), color under the mouse, control ClassNN, text, position/size, status bar text, and visible/all window text. It includes options to follow the mouse or track the active window's focused control and supports suspending updates.


## `memory/` Directory File Summary

*   `paths.ini`: An INI file storing various file paths used by the AHK scripts. It includes sections for system paths (`[paths]`), script paths (`[scripts]`), program paths (coding tools, browsers, office apps, games under `[paths]`), website URLs (`[sites]`), path groups (`[groups_def]`), cached paths (`[cache]`), and computer-specific overrides (`[ZEUS2]`, `[PHYAROM2]`). Environment variables like `%appdata%`, `%ProgramFiles%`, `%onedrive%`, `%user%`, and custom variables like `%pandora%`, `%ahk%` are used extensively.
*   `vnc_htostrings.json`: A JSON file containing a single key-value pair, likely related to VNC hotstrings, possibly for storing a specific mapping or configuration. The current content seems minimal (`"sdfdsf": "0"`).

*(Note: `.bak` files were ignored as they are likely backups.)*
